            <h4>How to play:</h4>
            <p>
                Blackjack is a card game, traditionally played in casinos, that
                pits Player v. Dealer.  The goal of the game is to get as close
                to 21 as possible without going over, which is reffered to as
                busting.
            </p>
            <p>
                During the player's turn, they have two options: Hit or Stand.
                If a player chooses to Hit, the dealer gives them another card.
                If a player chooses to Stand, the complete their turn, passing
                play to the player clockwise of them or to the dealer.
            </p>
            <p>
                The dealer's moves are automatic, as they always hit if their
                cards add up to less than 17 or stand if they do.  In the end,
                each player is evaluated to see if they win, lose, or tie,
                called a push.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cards with a number rank are evaluated to their rank, Aces can
                be either a 1 or 11, but in this version Aces are 1 unless
                given as one of the intial 2 cards, then they are evaluated
                as an 11.  Face cards are all 10.
